Implementation of some important Data Mining Algorithms.
  
  
## Principal Component Analysis with R Programming
 
Principal component analysis (PCA) in R programming is an analysis of the linear components of all existing attributes. Principal components are linear combinations (orthogonal transformation) of the original predictor in the dataset. It is a useful technique for EDA (exploratory data analysis) and allows you to better visualize the variations present in a dataset with many variables.
 
## Decision Tree
Decision Tree is one of the most powerful and popular algorithm. Decision-tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning algorithms. It works for both continuous as well as categorical output variables.
