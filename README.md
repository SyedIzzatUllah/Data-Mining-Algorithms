## Principal Component Analysis with R Programming

Principal component analysis(PCA) in R programming is an analysis of the linear components of all existing attributes. Principal components are linear combinations (orthogonal transformation) of the original predictor in the dataset. It is a useful technique for EDA(Exploratory data analysis) and allows you to better visualize the variations present in a dataset with many variables.
